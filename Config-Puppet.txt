What is Puppet
-- puppet is an open source software configuration management tool.
It runs on many unix-like systems as well as MIcrosoft Windows, and includes its own
declarative languages to describe system configuration.

What we requires on system 

Own declarative format 

Keyfeatures 
1. Large User base
2. Big open Source Community
3. Documentation
4. Platform Support

Puppet Architecture 

Puppet follows a Master Slave Architecure, 
puppet master 

puppet slave

SSL Connection

Puppet nodes have to interact with the master, all the information which is communicated between the master node
and the slave node are encrypted using SSL certficates, The certificate signing process is as follows

Puppet master ---------------------------------> puppet slave
puppet master <-------------------------------- puppet slave
puppet master ---------------------------------> puppet slave
puppet master <--------------------------------> pupper slave


Set up
---------
[master]
-apt update    apt --- install := > command
-apt-get install wget
wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet-release-bionic.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppet-release-bionic.deb  ---> unZip the file downloaded
sudo apt-get install puppetmaster ---> Install the puppetmaster

sudo apt policy puppetmaster --> Check the policy of puppet master

sudo systemctl status puppet-master.service -->
status of puppermaster service --- Whether it is enable or disable 
---Ubuntu base machine started connecting ot not???????????


vim /etc/default/puppet-master ---> 

-------> nano -- edit ----> shell scripting

1gb of memory --> 512 memory
--JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m - Xmx512m"

bydefaulr the device uses 1 gb of memroy ====> system is gonna be on 
overload, hence it has to be shorten\

sudo systemctl restart puppet-master.service

sudo ufw allow 8140/tcp

localhost:8080

8140 ===> default port number running our puppetserver (Puppet service)






Slave machine -- Puppet agent
=---------------------
//Puppet agent
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget
wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet-release-bionic.deb
sudo dpkg -i puppet-release-bionic.deb
sudo apt-get install puppet

enter IP address of master machine
sudo nano /etc/hosts --> IP Address of the master puppet - server

Note : Master IP addess needs to copied into master pupper-sever 
as well as puppet agent-server.

#Before this command...
sudo systemctl start puppet
sudo systemctl enable puppet

//on puppet master
sudo puppet cert list
sudo puppet cert sign --all

To verify now!!!
Create 

Manifest --> What all chages has to be made slave

//Change mode

--Master Server-----

mkdir -p /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/

nano /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifest/site.pp

<Deployement Acitvity>
----------------------------------------------
file {'/tmp/it_works.txt'; 	#resource type file and filename
    ensure => present,	#make sure it exists
    mode =>'0644',		#file permissions
    content => "It works on ${ipaddress_eth0}!\n", #Print the eth0 IP fact
}
